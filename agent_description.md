# Student Performance Analysis Agent

## 1. Agent Objective
The agent is designed to analyze student performance data and provide personalized feedback and recommendations. It processes quiz/test results, identifies weak areas, and generates detailed performance insights using AI-powered analysis through Gemini 2.0.

## 2. Input
The agent requires the following inputs through a Streamlit form:
- Student ID (text)
- Student Name (text)
- Subject/Quiz Topic (text)
- Percentage Marks (number: 0-100)
- Topics with Less Marks (comma-separated text)

## 3. Workflow

### Trigger
The workflow is triggered when a user submits the Streamlit form with student performance data.

### Step-by-step Process
1. **Data Collection**
   - User fills out the Streamlit form with student performance data
   - Form validation ensures all required fields are completed

2. **Data Processing**
   - Streamlit application sends data to N8N webhook
   - N8N workflow is triggered with the following data structure:
     ```json
     {
       "StudentID": "string",
       "StudentName": "string",
       "QuizTopic": "string",
       "ScorePercentage": float,
       "IncorrectTopics": "string"
     }
     ```

3. **AI Analysis**
   - N8N forwards the data to Gemini 2.0
   - Gemini processes the data and generates personalized analysis
   - Analysis includes:
     - Performance evaluation
     - Weak area identification
     - Improvement recommendations
     - Study strategies

4. **Data Storage**
   - Analysis results are stored in PostgreSQL via Supabase
   - Database schema includes:
     - Student information
     - Performance metrics
     - AI-generated analysis
     - Timestamp

5. **Result Display**
   - Streamlit application polls the database for results
   - Results are displayed in markdown format
   - Historical analyses are available for review

### Tools/Services Used
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Workflow Automation: N8N
- AI Analysis: Gemini 2.0
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- API Integration: Webhooks
